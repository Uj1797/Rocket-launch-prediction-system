# Space Y First Stage Landing Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focused on predicting the successful landing of Falcon 9 first stages. SpaceX's ability to reuse first stages significantly lowers launch costs compared to traditional providers, making predicting landing success crucial for cost estimation and competitive bidding in the aerospace industry.

## Objectives

- Collected Falcon 9 first-stage landing data using a RESTful API and web scraping methods.
- Performed data wrangling to convert and preprocess data into a Pandas DataFrame.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and Pandas to visualize and understand the dataset.
- Built an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash to analyze launch records and visualize trends.
- Utilized Folium to create an interactive map for analyzing launch site proximity.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python for data collection, manipulation, and analysis.
- Pandas for data wrangling and EDA.
- Plotly Dash for building interactive data dashboards.
- Folium for generating interactive maps.
- Machine learning models (SVM, Classification Trees, Logistic Regression) for predicting landing success.
- SQL for data querying and management.

## Project Structure

- Data Collection: Utilized APIs and web scraping to gather Falcon 9 landing data.
- Data Wrangling: Cleaned and preprocessed data into a structured format using Pandas.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized data using scatter plots, bar charts, and other visualizations to identify patterns.
- Dashboard Development: Built an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash to explore launch records and visualize insights.
- Machine Learning: Implemented SVM, Classification Trees, and Logistic Regression models to predict landing outcomes.
